# Product Overview

Dalbit Yaksok (달빛약속) is a Korean programming language that allows developers
to write code using natural Korean syntax. It's a fork of the original "Yaksok"
language, designed to make programming more accessible to Korean speakers by
using familiar language constructs.

The project provides:

- A runtime interpreter for executing Korean-language code
- Monaco Editor integration for web-based code editing with syntax highlighting
- FFI (Foreign Function Interface) support for interacting with
  JavaScript/Python
- QuickJS bridge for safe JavaScript execution within Yaksok code
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI assistant integration

The language uses natural Korean grammar patterns, including proper particle
variations (이/가, 을/를, 와/과) and verb conjugations, making code read like
natural Korean sentences.
